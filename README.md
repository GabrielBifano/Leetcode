# Leetcode
A repository with all of my leetcode solutions 🔥

This repo holds all of my solutions 🚀 to every leetcode problem i've taken so far.

### Structure:
They are separate by language (even though the great majority is in python), and are
named by its problem code number. Some of them might have more than one solution. Those
are sinalized with a " - " between its problem code number, and the implementation version

**example:**
- 📂 Python:
   - 🐍 11.py
	- 🐍 11-2.py
	- 🐍 1769.py
	- ...
- 📁 C++:
	- 🧮 11.cpp
	- ...

Inside each file there is a title with the problem's name, and a subtitle with it's difficulty
